# Cloud Elasticity and Scalability - CES
Students should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of cloud PaaS and IaaS vertical and horizontal scaling
configurations, with associated cost/performance trade-offs. Additionally, students should be able to implement a cloud service
with scaling and load balancing configured for a given application
deployment scenario. Consideration should also be given to geographical/regional scaling attributes of the deployed cloud service,
with a rationale presented on configuration choices.
## Learning Objectives.
* Discuss and critique the cost/performance characteristics
and trade-offs of using scalable cloud services.
* Describe the vertical and horizontal scaling approaches that
can be deployed to enhance the performance of a cloud
service.
* Configure and deploy a cloud service solution that addresses
the requirements of horizontal or vertical performance scaling and internal or external load balancing.
