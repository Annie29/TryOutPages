# Fault Tolerance, Resilience and Reliability - FTRR

Reliability is one desired property of any cloud-based solution, and
can be summarized as providing resources, bandwidth, and relevant
interfaces that perform consistently well, to maintain a high-level
of service availability, under dynamic conditions of the cloud. To
provide reliability, many cloud systems take advantage of an eclectic
resource-base and relevant tools that (i) can take resilient actions
autonomously to adapt to changing conditions on the cloud, and (ii)
can provide advanced fault tolerant mechanisms that can handle
failures.

Students should be able to understand the concepts of resource
dynamism and autonomy, and how the cloud is designed to take advantage of eclectic resource state to achieve high availability. They
should also acquire a basic understanding of how fault tolerance
can be ensured based on high availability. Additional topics include:
high availability, points of failures, service uptime and impact of
cloud-imposed delays, and disaster recovery.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify and list cloud tools to provide high availability.
* Understand load balancing mechanisms on the middleware.
* Define the concept of service availability, and classify different levels of availability.
* Explain the difference between availability and high availability.
* Describe and critique cloud-based fault tolerance technologies.
* Understand the concept of service-level agreements (SLAs),
and related requirements.
* Configure and deploy a fault tolerant cloud service solution
that meets the minimum SLA requirements.
