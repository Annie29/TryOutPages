# Software Development using Cloud APIs - SDCA

Implementation of a cloud-enabled system requires the ability to
integrate third-party application programming interfaces (APIs)
offered by the providers of cloud computing services. Common
implementation practices include cloud service integration at different levels. Service-level (Platform-as-a-Service) APIs provide
access to, and functionality of, a cloud environment allowing the
application to integrate with such systems as messaging, database,
and data storage. Application-level (Software-as-a-Service) APIs
connect the application with the cloud-enabled IT infrastructure
that could provide access to such applications as email and collaboration, customer relationship management, etc. Infrastructure-level
(Infrastructure-as-a-Service) APIs help control cloud resources, as
well as their distribution.

## Learning Objectives
* Define common implementation practices for cloud-based
software development.
* Explain the impact of using cloud computing solutions on
an application/service.
* Demonstrate the ability to apply commonly-accepted implementation practices.
* Analyze the impact on the application/service performance
and dependability resulting from migrating it to the cloud.
* Build a cloud-based application/service and experiment with
it under different conditions affecting its performance, reliability, and availability.
* Assess the factors influencing the performance, reliability,
and availability of the implemented cloud-based application/service.
