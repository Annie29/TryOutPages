# Networking Resources on the Cloud (NRC)
In this KA, students will gain an overview of general cloud-related
concepts for networking. Students will define and then utilize virtual networks in the cloud networking paradigm. Students will
design network models, and then deploy a developed virtual and
software-defined network (SDN) as part of utilizing cloud resources.
Students will identify how elasticity, federation, and interoperability play a role in networking resources on the cloud. Students will
also identify security concerns related to cloud networking and
access management in the cloud computing paradigm.
## Learning Objectives
* Discuss cloud networking as part of cloud utilization.
* Critique connectivity, and application interactions with the
network and novel techniques in each of these areas that are
pushing cloud computing capabilities farther.
* Define virtual networks as part of provisioning cloud resources on the cloud.
* Explain congestion control, to include TCP congestion control and how it impacts data flow in data centers.
* Design network architecture as part of utilizing cloud resources.
* Configure and provision network resources utilizing cloud
networking resources.
* Evaluate physical network structures, considering how the
increasing demand for bandwidth within data centers influences the network design.
* Discuss and explain the use of SDNs as part of cloud implementation to address virtual networking requirements and
challenges.
* Identify elasticity, federation and interoperability in cloud
utilization.
* Explain the importance of interoperability in utilizing multiple cloud networking resources.
* Identify security issues and apply learned threat mitigation
techniques at the multiple layers of the network.
