# Cloud Deployment, Monitoring and Maintenance - CDMM
This KA focuses on how the cloud changes the way software applications are developed, run and managed. Using a "service oriented"
approach, software developed to be run in a cloud environment
leverages new tools and methods for monitoring application performance and making changes or upgrades throughout the application
lifecycle. This includes application and service deployment, service
and resource monitoring, and service and resource maintenance.
## Learning Objectives
* Deploy a software application as a cloud service.
* Enroll a monitoring tool to evaluate application performance
and resource utilization.
* Establish automated rules to scale the application based on
performance and utilization.
* Revise zone, region, or locations of the application based on
performance and use case.
* Create a Cloud Integration and Cloud Development (CICD)
"pipeline" process for maintenance upgrades, patches and
changes to the application.
