# Cloud Programming Models and Frameworks - CPMF

In this KA, students will explore the various capabilities of cloudbased programming models and frameworks. Students will understand the benefits and limitations of each so that they can assess
applicability based on the problem domain. Students will gain working experience in one or more of these programming models.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain how to describe data in motion, data flow definitions, regular expression, message formats and canonical
data models.
* Describe the aspects of and the differences between different
programming models.
* Discuss the execution flow, scheduling and fault tolerance
concepts in various programming models.
* Recall and contrast different popular cloud programming
models.
* Discuss the features and advantages of various parallel and
distributed programming models.
* Differentiate between interactive (non-batch), batch, and
stream processing models and their applicability to different
problem domains.
* Illustrate and explain the execution workflow, overhead, fault
tolerance and logical flow of a cloud-based programming
framework.
* Design and implement a solution to pre-process a large textbased dataset for data cleaning purposes using a cloud-based
programming framework.
* Implement an application using a cloud-based programming
framework.
* Investigate the possible sources of different bug types in
cloud-based programming framework programs using log
files.
* Explore optimization topics in the cloud-based programming
framework.
