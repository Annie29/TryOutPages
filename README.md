# Toward Developing a Cloud Computing Model Curriculum

This is the initial working area for the ITiCSE 2019 Working Group working to
create Cloud Computing Resources.

##  Working Group Description

Cloud computing continues to be important in higher education, as it is becoming the common infrastructure for advanced technology. However, finding high-quality curricular materials to teach cloud concepts is an ongoing challenge.

A 2018 Working
Group created a report  that among other things described fourteen Knowledge Areas (KAs) for teaching cloud concepts. Each of these KAs had numerous Learning Objectives (LOs) included.
But that report is only the beginning of creating a framework that can both adapt to changes in the field and provide faculty with current resources.

The next working group will respond to both of these issues by expanding on the KAs.  In particular, it will:

* Provide a list of resources that will enable an educator to teach the KA in their context.
* Survey existing cloud computing courses to find course exemplars of using the KAs, much as is done in Appendix C of~\cite{csc2013}.
* Survey the current job market and create a mapping of KAs to cloud job titles.
* Establish a way to add and remove materials from the resources list to ensure they stay current.
* Create an online repository to hold all of this material. It appears GitHub can provide this functionality, but preliminary WG work will ensure it is workable.

We envision this will ultimately provide a framework similar to that done for NICE, TCPP Curriculum, or CSinParallel.

We will also entertain the possibility of having a community website for
hands-on modules that can be easily integrated into curricula, as well as
building a repository of assignments following the recent nifty/peachy
assignments model.
