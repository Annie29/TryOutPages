# Cloud Security, Privacy, Policy and Ethics - CSPPE
Students will be able to define security governance policies, and
principles / risk management compliance related needs and issues.
Students will describe how the human component and access management is an important part of cloud security management. Students should demonstrate understanding by implementing best
practices in security operations, security engineering, use of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad, and assessment
and testing in threat evaluation and mitigation.

* Explain security related implications of the cloud computing
paradigm.
* Demonstrate the use of security controls in the cloud computing environment.
* Describe security policies and strategies for achieving compliance in cloud computing.
* Describe security related governing laws and regulations in
cloud computing.
* Design a secure architecture model for a cloud-enabled computing system using security design principles.
* Implement security policies and plans in the cloud security
environment.
* Summarize best practices of cloud computing security and
describe their rationale.
* Understand security threats in cloud computing.
* Apply forensics techniques for investigation and analysis in
cloud computing.
* Explain the nature of cloud computing threat mitigation.
* Practice the process of cloud computing threat mitigation.
* Analyze different strategies and develop a plan for cloud
computing threat mitigation.
* Use commonly accepted secure software development practices in cloud computing.
* Test for threat vulnerabilities in a cloud computing application/system (penetration testing, ethical hacking).
* Discuss ethical principles of obtaining and use of cloud platform resources and the need to guard against bias.
* Discuss ethical and accountability issues of data and services
among cloud platforms.
