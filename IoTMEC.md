# IoT, Mobile, Edge and the Cloud - IoTMEC

The downward pressure on price for compute has pushed a significant amount of processing down to the device level. Whereas
Mobile computing leverages the resources of smart phones, IoT and
Edge computing refer to the advent of smart devices and “meshes” to monitor and coordinate these devices. These three delivery methods enable applications and services to run on independent and
decentralized environments.

Edge moves cloud analytics and custom business logic to devices so organizations can focus on business insights instead of
data management. This enables IoT solutions to scale by configuring software, deploying it to devices via standard containers, and
monitoring it all from the cloud.

Students should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of IoT communication, security, and data formats, with
emphasis on interoperability and lightweight communication. In
particular, students should be able to implement a cloud-connected
IoT solution using suitable cloud API services to support lightweight, scalable data storage and communication.

Learning Objectives
* Critically assess the separate and composite impact of cloud
and mobile computing technologies upon the social behavior
of the individual and society.
* Critically evaluate the methods of open data specification,
interoperability, formats and delivery mechanisms in the
Internet of Things.
* Critique the fundamental tradeoffs related to compute, power
limitations and communication needs in these systems.
* Specify, design, and develop cloud-connected IoT applications capable of sending and receiving sensor data.
*  Demonstrate IoT Edge within the context of current applications of mobile and sensor systems.
