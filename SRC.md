# Storage Resources on the Cloud - SRC
In this KA, students will understand, appreciate and gain insight
into the differences between different types and schema of data.
Students will compare and utilize different cloud storage types,
whether block or object storage, and determine their suitability
for a given scenario. Students will understand and compare the
functionality and affordances of file systems and distributed file
systems. Students will collect, store, extract, query and analyze data
in files, relational databases (SQL), NoSQL databases, as well as
Data Warehouses.
## Learning Objectives
### Data
* Describe data types (as in text, audio, images, video, etc.).
List the differences between structured and unstructured
data. Give examples of each type of data.
* Given a scenario using storage, determine whether the storage abstraction should be structured or unstructured and give reasons for this decision. Decide on an appropriate cloud
based storage solution.
* Describe the difference between static and dynamic/streaming
data and the implications this has on cloud data storage selection.
* Create, populate, access, and manipulate cloud data storage
suitable for storing structured data.
* Create, populate, access, and manipulate cloud data storage
suitable for storing unstructured data.
* Manipulate the sharing and privacy settings for an existing
data stored on the cloud.
* Discuss the techniques and costs to migrate data from and
to the cloud. Practice moving a large data set to and from
the cloud or across different cloud service providers.
* Consolidate heterogeneous data types and schema into a
single schema.
### Storage
* Enumerate and define the characteristics of different storage types and describe the differences between them. For a
given scenario, determine the best storage type and give the
reasons for this decision.
* Illustrate the abstractions offered by file systems and distributed file systems. Compare and contrast different types
of file systems.
* Compare and contrast different types of databases and discuss their design trade-offs.
* Discuss the concepts of cloud object storage as well as their
programming interfaces.
* Explain and compare the advantages and disadvantages of
flat files, SQL databases, and NoSQL database solutions.
* Practice the basics of SQL language to gather insights from
relational databases.
* Implement a prototype of a key-value store supporting different data structures.
* Configure, deploy and utilize a NoSQL database solution in
a web service.
* Build and execute analytics queries against a large data set
in a data warehouse.
* Describe the motivation, advantages and disadvantages of
adopting software defined storage (SDS).
* Recognize the issues in storing state outside of a database in
a cache.
