# Cloud Orchestration - CO

This area covers how the cloud impacts deployment methods and
frameworks, for how software applications are developed and deployed. 
This includes the ability for students to build any application, on 
any cloud, using popular application frameworks, and CICD
pipeline and monitoring. Students should be able to demonstrate
an understanding in the automation of workflow processes and
the creation, monitoring and deployment of resources supporting
the applications. Examples of specific techniques and tools in this
area are: Software Delivery, DevOps, CICD, and platform-agnostic
’Infrastructure-as-code’.
